A React App to search up your favorite robots. 

Built for my Complete Web Developer course, this project employs React, Tachyons, and outside API calls to create a dynamic, styalized and stateful application. API's used inclued JSONPlaceholder for basic user information and RoboHash for user images. The search bar and title remain on screen regardless of screensize or scrolling.
